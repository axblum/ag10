// Person 1 - User Stories

// The user wants to input a list of numbers (that can be any length) into the following
// functions.

// Function 1
// The user wants a function 'sum' that should add up all the numbers in the list
// and outputs a single number: the 'sum'.


// Function 2
// The user wants a function 'mean' that finds the average of all the numbers in the list
// (via summing all the numbers and dividing it by the length of the list). This function
// should output a single number: the 'mean'.

// Function 3
// The user wants a function 'median' that should order the list of numbers and find the
// number in the middle. If the list has an even number of numbers, the two numbers in 
// the middle should be averaged for the median. The function should output a single number
// the median.
